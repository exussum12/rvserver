Two notes about this:

- Right now, you need to make a "logs" folder in the same directory as the
  chat server. All logs are stored there. If you don't make the folder, the
  chat will fail to start. It's dumb, I know; I just haven't changed it yet.

- The "config.txt" also must be in the same directory as the chat server (see
  above). It works with simple key=value pairs. I left comments so you can
  mess around with them. If you have ideas for more stuff that might need to
  be modifed, let me know.

Thanks, and have fun! :P
