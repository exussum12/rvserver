Two notes about this:

- Configuration is loaded from ~/.rvserver for the running user. The file
  in the pack (config.txt) contains all the valid configuration options.

- Logs are saved in whatever directory LogPath is set to. If it doesn't exist,
  the binary will do its best to try and create it. (No guarantees.)

Thanks, and have fun! :P
